        <h1>the official unofficial aphex twin faq</h1>

        <p>The afxfaq26.txt file that has been around in my files for quite some time, I remember I copied this one from one of the CDs that I got from friend, yes, back then (probably around year 2003) internet was still a thing and I used to pay for Dial-up 56k and managed to get money from my parents for 1 hour per week so CD/DVD was a precious source of information for me.</p>
        
        <p>Also, around that time (2002/2003) I discovered Aphex Twin, still remember obtaining a MP3 CD with the full discography and being overwhelmed with the amount of the material that I saw on that CD and parallelly still enjoying the tunes from my already favourite bands Underworld, Orbital, Massive Attack... didn't dare to deep dive into the new materia and just ignored that for some time. Then, while studing for the exam in "Electronic components and materials" I listened the discography specifically "Selected Ambient Works 85–92" album which blew my mind, it will definitely be the album of that time and I will always connect the this album with that period. </p>
        
        <p>Since then Aphex Twin became a really important artist for me and opened the new sphere of IDM artists including Squarepusher, Autechre, µ-Ziq, etc. Therefore I started to collect the materials including this FAQ that was the part of the discography CD.</p>
        
        <p>You will notice that the version 2.6 of the FAQ dates to February 2000. I believe this is the last version ever published. There was also an email address and website [http://www.aphextwin.org/] whre you could colaborate to the FAQ but unfortunately the website stopped existing somewhere around September 2001, this is at least what <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010927041120/http://aphextwin.org:80/">archive.org</a> says.</p>

   A:1 "What is Aphex Twin?"

 Aphex Twin is the ongoing project of Richard D. James, a brilliant modern
 composer of electronic music, sound, and noise. He has been hailed from both
 sides of the Atlantic as "the one-man Kraftwerk" and "the next Mozart"
 showing that his music knows no geographical boundaries. Known for his
 faster-than-lightning snare rushes just as much as for his beatless ambient
 loops, Richard's music is never the same sound twice.

 Some would try to categorise Aphex Twin as "ambient," "electronica,"
 "intelligent dance music," "jungle," or even "noise." They would all be
 correct, but it is much safer to say that with each new release, the sounds
 created by Richard are torn down and rebuilt from the ground up without
 giving a second thought to what the press or listening public may think.
 There are some similarities among all of his works, but each track can
 definitely hold its own.

 See section A.11b for more information on musical classification.



A:2 "What does Aphex Twin mean?"

 The "Aphex" in Aphex Twin is actually a registered trademark of Aphex
 Systems, Ltd. a manufacturer of pro audio and broadcast sound processing
 products (most well-known for their Aural Exciter). Some recent releases
 include the line "Aphex is a registered trademark of Aphex Systems Ltd and
 is used by permission" somewhere on the package. But, according to the
 February 13, 1993 issue of NME:

 "Richard came across the word by accident, using the 'A' in Aphex for the
 acid element in his sound, and the 'ph' as the pH value of acid. He hadn't
 even heard of an Aural Exciter until he'd had a few records out. He is, let's
 face it, the last person who'd name himself after a piece of gear made by
 somebody else: he was constructing his own synthesisers at 13."

 At one time, the "Twin" was thought to be a reference to Tom Middleton (see
 section A9ee) who shares the same date of birth as Richard. Tom also
 collaborated with Richard on his first release. It should be made clear,
 though, that although Tom has referred to _himself_ as the "Twin" in Aphex
 Twin, Richard underplays all that. The Aphex Twin name was around before they
 ever recorded together.

 The real story behind the "Twin" in Aphex Twin is best told by Richard when
 he speaks of his brother with whom he actually shares the same name. See
 section G.11 for more information regarding Richard's late brother.



A:3a "What other pseudonyms has Richard used in the past?"

 Known pseudonyms include AFX, The Aphex Twin, Polygon Window, Caustic Window,
 Blue Calx, The Dice Man, GAK, Power-Pill, Q-Chastic, Soit-P.P., and Rich (of
 Mike & Rich). Of all this madness he says:

 "They existed before I got into the music business. I used to make up little
 names on tapes and stuff when I used to catalogue my stuff, and that's why I
 made up most of the names. And then it sort of worked quite nicely when I got
 into the music business, 'cause I just gave different names to different
 record companies, and I thought that was quite cool. But now with so much
 music being out on the, sort of, scene, splintered up so much into different
 bits, and people have like five labels for different types of music and
 stuff. I thought it was quite a good idea at first, but now I really don't
 like it. I want it to be all back together again; I want to go out to a club
 and listen to all different types, not just one specialist type of jungle. I
 think having different names breaks it up, so that's why I'm sticking to two
 again, now, to keep it all under the same names."

 At one point he actually lost track of all of them, so future releases will
 only be put out as AFX (on Rephlex) and Aphex Twin (on Warp). Unless, of
 course, he is releasing old material, which will be released under the alias
 for which it was originally intended. But in the end, he says they are all
 the same to him anyway.



A:3b "Is The Diceman really Richard?"

 No. Not if you are referring to the one on Vivatonal Records. The Diceman is
 not anything to do with Richard D. James. The Diceman is the alias used for
 certain projects of Colin James (Jolly James, Gregg Retch, formerly of Meat
 Beat Manifesto). All releases by The Diceman have been mistaken as being done
 by Richard D. James for multiple reasons. One reason is that Richard did do a
 track on Warp Records' _Artificial Intelligence_ compilation under the alias
 The Dice Man (notice the distinct space between "Dice" and "Man"). The track
 was called "Polygon Window" and later showed up on his very own Polygon
 Window album _Surfing On Sine Waves_. This was the only use of the alias for
 Richard as he was forced to retire it after finding out about the other
 Diceman.

 Additionally, The Diceman releases (on Vivatonal Records) give credit to
 "Jolly James," "C. James," and "S. James." The last name "James" seems to
 mislead quite a few people. And to confuse matters further, S. James (Scott)
 is indeed another (third) person, but he is related to neither Richard nor
 Colin James. All three James are unrelated.

 To sum it up, The Dice Man is Richard, The Diceman is Colin. If you are
 looking for Richard's music, get _Artificial Intelligence_ then stop looking
 for dice anything. Better yet, just buy _Surfing On Sine Waves_. You'll get
 more Richard for your money.

 On a related note, the alias itself probably comes from a 1972 novel by Luke
 Rhinehart (a pen name of George Cockcroft) entitled _The Dice Man_. It deals
 with a doctor who decides to use dice in every decision he makes. A very
 highly recommended book.



A:4 "What Aphex Twin albums are out there?"

 produced. It is in no way the best or most complete discography you will
 find. For that, please direct your World Wide Web browser to Richard D. James

 NOTE: A double zero indicates information unknown. Obviously, there is no
 date 00. At least, not on _my_ calendar, so that's what that means. Also,
 dates reflect first available releases. The dates may reflect US, UK, or
 other countries' release dates based on the first available pressing.



A:5 "Is Aphex Twin really only one person?"

 To date, all Aphex Twin work has been the work of Richard D. James and
 Richard D. James alone. Other pseudonyms, however, have given Richard the
 freedom to collaborate with others such as Mike Paradinas (Mike & Rich) and
 Tom Jenkinson (Squarepusher/AFX). Most of Richard's collaborative works are
 clearly labelled so there is usually no confusion. If there is any question,
 though, chances are he worked on it solo.



A:6 "Who is Richard D. James?"

 Richard's Statistics:

       Full Name : Richard David James
         Born On : August 18, 1971
         Born In : Cornwall, England, United Kingdom
      Eye Colour : Hazel
     Hair Colour : Noisy Red
  Marital Status : Single
        Location : Stoke Newington, London, England, United Kingdom
       Education : 1 year at Kingston Polytechnic University

 Born Richard David James in Cornwall, England (the place where the legend of
 King Arthur supposedly started), he enjoys computer games and paintball
 (aside from making noise). His first recordings were made at the age of
 fourteen. Later, he did take an electronics course at Kingston Polytechnic in
 London but dropped out after a year. "It was doing my head in," he said. "I
 wanted to get out and make music."

 The parents of the electro-avant-gardist who reckons Mozart is "pretty
 wicked" met while working in a mental hospital. His father, Richard claims,
 used to dole out the LSD prescribed to patients. Sometimes, at the
 encouragement of the staff nurse, they used to take it themselves. His father
 moved to Cornwall, Ontario, Canada, to work as a miner in the county's doomed
 tin mines. In 1968, Richard's brother died at birth, and his grave is still
 in Canada. After the mines closed in the 1980s, Richard's father worked
 capping old mines, filling shafts that were in danger of collapsing. His
 parents now reside in Wales.
 
 The younger of his two sisters was into The Jesus And Mary Chain, and had
 boyfriends who played in indie bands. Richard never had much time for guitar
 rock. "I thought some of that stuff was quite good, but I didn't really like
 it." Richard's favourite pastime was playing with sound, taping and editing
 on reel to reels, playing them backwards, and changing speeds. The family had
 a piano that he recorded too, messing up the strings and hammers to make
 different noises. It drove his mother up the wall. By his teenage years, he
 was playing with a cheap synthesiser, a Sinclair Spectrum computer, and a
 cheap sampler. The mum of one of his childhood friends says: "Richard was a
 bit of a handful to his mother."



A:7 "Where does Richard live?"

 To the best of my knowledge, he is still living in the bank that he purchased
 for the recording of _Come To Daddy_. See section H.1 for more information.



A:8 "What kind of equipment does Aphex Twin use?"

 Originally, Richard was known for creating his own equipment. He would use
 shells of other devices and fill them with his own circuits, but these days
 he doesn't use the electronic stuff he made before. He uses about two things
 that he built when he was younger, and that's all. He's strictly into the
 computer domain. He has three computers: two laptops and a PowerPC. In fact,
 almost the entire _Richard D. James Album_ was done on his PowerPC.

 He has always been into computers, but, according to him, "they weren't good
 enough for a while."

 "Computers were too rubbish for me to get into them, but now they've reached
 really good heights again, and I'm really back into them." He has even
 started to write his own software. He has never been one to use standard
 tools, so virtually every aspect of his music-making has been customised in
 some way, shape, or form. That is part of what gives his music it's unique
 sound.

 One of his favourite mainstream tools is Steinberg's ReCycle. "Yeah, it's
 quite a wicked program. The most useful thing about it is it creates a bank
 on your sampler, and gives it loads of sample names. And that saves you an
 hour, at least. You can cut something up into, like, 90 samples, and transfer
 it over SCSI in a minute. That would take two hours normally." And not only
 for breakbeats, Richard uses ReCycle for melodic material as well. "I might
 play a violin or a trumpet scale into Pro Tools -- every note I can think
 of -- and then bang it into ReCycle, chop it up into little bits, bang it
 into the sampler, and you've got a complete bank of sounds in your sampler in
 about five minutes.

 "That's what I'm into now. I don't muck around with electronics anymore but I
 probably will get back into it soon because it's still got advantages. It's
 nice to have something in your hands rather than on a screen. I'm really into
 computers because obviously you can do something with it -- I'll be dealing
 with electronics in a nostalgic way not in an inventive way. Using older
 electronics for an older type of sound. My prime motivation is to do
 something new all the time and keep exploring. Computers are so powerful now,
 there's so much to be done with them really."

 As far as live shows are concerned, it took about a year, but he has finally
 filled his laptop with everything he needs to tour. Well, _almost_
 everything. He also uses a little mixer, and an effects unit. But soon he
 will be eradicating the mixer and effects unit, so basically it will just be
 one computer. It does everything he did before with live samples and
 sequences. He has put every element down on a digital track in Digidesign's
 Pro Tools, so he can mix between tracks.



A:9 "What is Aphex Twin's connection to..."

a. "...The Beatniks?"

 Aphex Twin remixed "Une Femme N'est Pas Un Homme" for The Beatniks' _Another
 High Exit_, released in 1994.

~~~

b. "...Beck?"

 Richard remixed Beck's "Devil's Haircut" into "Richard's Hairpiece" for _The
 New Pollution_.

~~~

c. "...Bradley Strider?"

 What kind of question is that? If anyone has ever told you that there is no
 such thing as a stupid question, they would be very wrong. You just asked
 one. Some questions are better left ignored and unanswered.

~~~

d. "...Buck-Tick?"

 Aphex Twin remixed "In The Glitter Pt. 2" for _Shapeless_.

~~~

e. "...Chris Jeffs (Cylob, Kinesthesia)?"

 "I met him at Sound City in Sheffield," Richard says, "when I had to do a
 half-hour live thing in between M-People and Jamiroquai which I thought was
 wicked. It was weird, actually, because someone had taken this photo of me
 when I was playing and there's this mad-looking guy looking down on the stuff
 and I thought, 'Look at that geezer, he just looks like a total
 trainspotter.' And it was Chris. I didn't know that at the time though. His
 stuff really freaked me out, because he's made the most violent records I've
 ever heard: more violent than any gabba, and he's such a mellow guy, really
 quiet. He's got a little demon inside.

 "You want to see Cylob when he's pissed, he's well psycho. We were in New
 York once and there was this free musician thing in this bar where people
 came in and did whatever they wanted. He went on the mic about 20 minutes
 just doing stupid noises. All these New York people clapped for him as well.
 Then he threw a glass at my head. Hours and hours later we found him asleep
 in this doorway in the snow. He would've fuckin' had it, but he didn't care."

 Richard later remixed "Triachus" for Kinesthesia's _Empathy Box Remixes_
 release. Cylob also did a remix of "Ventolin" for the _Ventolin Remixes_ EP.

~~~

f. "...Curve?"

 A remix of Curve's "Falling Free" on _Falling Free_ was done by Richard.

~~~

g. "...Ed Upton (DMX Krew)?"

 The _Ffressshh!_ release by DMX Krew contains "You Can't Hide Your Love
 (Aphex Twin Mix)."

~~~

h. "...Die Fantastischen Vier?"

 "Krieger (Aphex Twin Baldhu Mix)" on _Live Und Direkt_ is a remix "for a
 German hip-hop band, called something like the Fantastic Four," explains
 Richard, "and they're sort of a really big pop/hip-hop band, and I did a
 pretty mad mix of that, like chopped the bloke's voice up into millions of
 little bits and re-organised it, so you didn't know what they were saying. I
 don't know what I've arranged it into. I don't know what I've made him say
 because I can't speak German."

~~~

i. "...Gavin Bryars?"

 Gavin Bryars' sons are great fans of Richard's, and they told him to get
 Richard to remix one of his tracks. So the tracks "Raising The Titanic
 (Edit)" and "Raising The Titanic (Big Drum Mix)" from _Raising The Titanic:
 The Aphex Twin Mixes_ are the results of Richard's work for Gavin Bryars.

~~~

j. "...The Gentle People?"

 One time neighbours of Richard James allowed him to remix a track of theirs.
 "Journey (Aphex Twin Care Mix)" appears on _Journey_.

~~~

k. "...Grant Wilson-Claridge (IG-88)?"

 Grant is Richard's partner in the Rephlex record label. See section A.11a for
 further information regarding Rephlex Records.

~~~

l. "...Jesus Jones?"

 Richard remixed "Zeroes & Ones" into "Zeroes & Ones (Aphex Twin
 Reconstruction #1 Mix)" and "Zeroes & Ones (Aphex Twin Reconstruction #2
 Mix)" for Jesus Jones' _Zeroes & Ones_.

~~~

m. "...Johnny Hawk (Global Goon)?"

 He used to live below Richard in a communal house. "He's really cool, really
 mellow," Richard points out.

~~~

n. "...The Lemonheads?"

 In Richard's own words:

 "I admit that sometimes I don't put any work into remixing at all. Sometimes
 I just give them an old, completely different track and say, 'Yeah, there's
 your remix.' I did that with The Lemonheads. I couldn't be bothered to do
 their track 'cause it was so shit. I don't know if they noticed or not 'cause
 I never bothered talking to any of them.

 "Basically, I was supposed to do it but I forgot the courier was coming that
 day. The doorbell rang, and I realised I'd forgotten so I just told him
 'Fifteen minutes,' went upstairs, found an old track, taped it off, and gave
 it to him. I got paid four grand for that. A nice day's work. I've done that
 a few times, but I don't always do it."

~~~

o. "...Luke Vibert (Plug, Wagon Christ, Vibert of Vibert and Simmonds)?"

 Luke Vibert was the featured DJ on all the gigs apart from one on Richard's
 1997 tour. Both Richard and Luke are Cornwall natives. He knew Richard quite
 a long time before Richard knew him, because Richard used to DJ and Luke
 would go to listen to Richard play. Richard was mates with him for a while
 before he found out Luke actually made music as well. They have now
 transcended the first name basis, and Luke actually calls him Aphex. As far
 as music is concerned, Richard did a remix of the Wagon Christ track
 "Spotlight" for the _Redone_ EP, and Luke is credited with additional
 production for "Ventolin (Deep Gong Mix)" on _Ventolin Remixes_.

~~~

p. "...Meat Beat Manifesto?"

 Aphex Twin remixed "Mindstream" for the Meat Beat Manifesto release
 _Mindstream_.

~~~

q. "...Mescalinum United?"

 The tracks on The Aphex Twin's _Classics_ album "We Have Arrived (Aphex Twin
 QQT Mix)" and "We Have Arrived (Aphex Twin TTQ Mix)" are remixes of the
 original "We Have Arrived" by Mescalinum United.

~~~

r. "...The Mike Flowers Pops?"

 _The Freebase Connection_ showcases "Debase (Soft Palate)" co-written by
 "R. James" and "produced by The Aphex Twin."

~~~

s. "...Mike Paradinas (µ-Ziq, Mike of Mike and Rich)?"

 Mike runs the record label Planet µ. He has remixed "On" for _On Remixes_ and
 Richard has done various remixes for Mike. The most notable connection,
 however, would be their collaboration on the _Expert Knob Twiddlers_ album as
 Mike & Rich (see section X.6).

~~~

t. "...Nav Katze?"

 In 1994, the songs "Ziggy" and "Change" appeared on _Never Mind The
 Distortion_, a Japanese and Australian only release.

~~~

u. "...Nine Inch Nails?"

 The songs "At The Heart Of It All" "created by Aphex Twin" and "The Beauty Of
 Being Numb" "section B created by Aphex Twin" appear on the Nine Inch Nails
 US release _Further Down The Spiral_. Richard has also expressed an interest
 in touring with Nine Inch Nails.

~~~

v. "...Nobukazu Takemura?"

 On Nobukazu Takemura's _Let My Fish Loose_, the song "Let My Fish Loose" was
 remixed by Richard D. James.

~~~

w. "...Oval?"

 There is a program from the people of Oval which functions as sort of a CD
 player on the Macintosh platform. It has a record button which lets you
 collect samples from the CD and rearrange them into a track that sounds like
 an Oval track. You can then add it to the menu of your CD so that every time
 you reopen the CD, you have more tracks: your own Oval re-mixes of the CD
 available to play.

 "They did that to my album, actually: Selected Ambient Works," claims
 Richard. "I am good at recognising sounds, I swear they did it. I was really
 getting into the album, and thinking, yeah, that sounds really familiar, and
 found my whole album being torn apart, it's quite good though, and I didn't
 know which way to take it. Did they like my album or did they just think,
 'Well, this CD is rubbish; let's tear it apart'? That was what I liked most
 about their record."

~~~

x. "...Philip Glass?"

 Richard originally did "ICCT Hedral" with real instruments in mind. He did
 the mix that appears on _...I Care Because You Do_ and thought it would be
 nice to have it played with real instruments. Rather than "get someone sort
 of standard" who could score it for an orchestra, he wanted to get someone
 who he liked to do it. Philip Glass was on his list of people.

 "I had Michael Nyman down, and he was well into it, but he was really busy,
 couldn't do it for like a year or something. And Philip Glass was ready to
 roll with it. I just wrote him a letter. I was quite a big fan of his work;
 that's why I picked him, basically. They did one take and I didn't like it,
 and I couldn't quite work out what they'd done at all, I didn't like it at
 all. And I was in New York at the time; so we went to meet him and I was
 like, yeah, I didn't like what you did, and I said exactly why, and he was,
 like, agreeing with me. And then they said, well, they would be up for doing
 something else -- try again. So I went over and, like, helped them. They did
 most of it, and I just sat there and sort of said a few things now and
 again."

 The song "ICCT Hedral (Philip Glass Orchestration)" appears on the _Donkey
 Rhubarb_ EP. Also, possibly to return the favour, Richard remixed the track
 "Heroes" for Glass's _"Heroes" Symphony_ release featuring vocals by David
 Bowie.

~~~

y. "...Phillip Boa?"

 The 1998 German release of _Love Me Like An Alien_ features track 4, "Deep In
 Velvet (Turnips Mix)," remixed by Aphex Twin. The 12" for _Deep In Velvet
 RMX_ also features the same track.

~~~

z. "...Reload?"

 Reload remixed "On" for the _On Remixes_ release.

~~~

aa. "...Saint Etienne?"

 Saint Etienne's _Who Do You Think You Are_ includes the tracks mixed by The
 Aphex Twin at Llanerlog Studios, Cornwall, "Who Do You Think You Are
 (Quex-RD)" and "Your Head My Voice (Voix Revirement)." The first track was
 also used on _Casino Classics_ and _Too Young To Die_.

~~~

bb. "...Seefeel?"

 "Time To Find Me (AFX Fast Mix)" and "Time To Find Me (AFX Slow Mix)" were
 remixed by none other than Richard D. James. These tracks appear on Seefeel's
 _Time To Find Me_, _Pure, Impure_, and _Polyfusia_.

~~~

cc. "...Soft Ballet?"

 The Polygon Window remix of "Sand Lowe" appears on _Twist And Turn_.

~~~

dd. "...Tom Jenkinson (Squarepusher, Chaos AD)?"

 The Squarepusher/AFX duet, "Freeman, Hardy & Willis Acid," is featured on the
 _We Are Reasonable People_ compilation, Warp Records' hundredth single
 (WAP100) which isn't really a single itself. Richard thinks fondly of Tom.

 Also, the liner notes for Squarepusher's _Feed Me Weird Things_ are signed by
 "Prichard D. Jams."  Go figure.

~~~

ee. "...Tom Middleton?"

 Richard's first release, _Analogue Bubblebath 1_, was recorded with Tom
 Middleton and credited to "Aphex Twin Featuring Schizophrenia." It appeared
 on the Mighty Force label in September 1991. Middleton left later that year
 to form Global Communication. They also share the same date of birth.

~~~

ff. "...Peter Ford (Baby Ford)?"

 The _Normal_ release (1998) was released in two parts. The first part
 (BFORD15X/T) contains the track "Normal (Helston Flora Remix by AFX)." The
 second part (BFORD15R/A) contains three more remixes all by Baby Ford. The
 AFX mix is definitely on the first part. Some people have been finding that
 out the hard way. It can be very disappointing.



A:10a "If I like Aphex Twin, what other music might I like?"

 There is certainly no way to tell for sure what music any one person may or
 may not like. In fact, it may depend on your mood at the time. But first,
 check out all the artists on the Rephlex label. Next, try listening to the
 artists on the Warp label. Since Richard has so many different sounds, it is
 possible that you will find another artist on one of those labels with a
 sound that suits your ears.

 If you like the hard, abrasive tracks, check out artists on Nothing Records
 (Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor's record label). In fact, that is the label
 some Warp and Rephlex artists are using to release some of their material on
 in the US. You also might even be interested in music by modern composers
 such as Philip Glass and Gavin Bryars. What the hell, if you like Aphex Twin,
 there's no telling _what_ other noise you'll put up with.



A:10b "What music does Richard like?"

 In a September 1997 interview with Theresa Stern for Perfect Sound Forever
 (http://www.furious.com/perfect/) Richard was quoted as saying:

 "I like the old tape and avant-garde music. I really like Stockhausen's first
 record. It's awesome. Don't really like much else after that. 'Songs of
 Youth' is my favorite one. Tod Dockstader as well. He's an American
 [composer] from the 1960s, working with tape music. At the moment, I like
 Luke Vibert. He's doing this [1997] tour with me. I love his music. I like
 Squarepusher as well."

 After the interview, he listed off some music along with an explanation.

  + Drexciya's _The Quest_
  + Erik Satie's "Trois Gymnopédies"
  + _Return of the DJ_
  + Squarepusher's _Big Loada_
  + Luke Vibert's _Big Soup_
  + Batucada's _The Sound Of The Favelas_
  + _Best Of Acid 1_
  + Ween's _Pod_ and _Pure Guava_
  + Les Baxter's _Exotic Moods Of Les Baxter_
  + Serge Gainsbourg
  + Tod Dockstader's _Apocalypse_ [mistaken by Richard as "Luna Park"]

 "Drexciya are from Detriot, part of Underground Resistance," Richard offers
 as an explantion. "I really like them. _Return of the DJ_ is music from
 California. It's avant-garde hip-hop, taking it to another extreme with a lot
 of excessive scratching and cutting up. Batucada are from South America with
 really, really fast rhythms with screaming and shouting with no songs. _Best
 Of Acid 1_ is old school from 1988 with all of these Chicago producers and
 acid tunes. I love Ween. I really, really like them and everything they do.
 I'm well into Les Baxter, a right weirdo. I have this double CD by Gainsbourg
 that I like a lot with 'Lemon Incest' on it. [The 2CD set is _Gainsbourg A
 Gainsbarre_.] I've got CDs by Nurse With Wound and Harry Partch with me, but
 I haven't listened to them yet."

 A more straightforward answer to the question of what music Richard likes
 would be: A lot of weird shit.



A:11a "What is 'Rephlex'?"

 Located in the darkest part of London, England, United Kingdom, and spreading
 as far as Cornwall, "Rephlex" is Richard D. James' own record label. He
 co-formed the label with Grant Wilson-Claridge around 1991. As the story
 goes, Grant first came across Richard at a tiny club called The Bowgie in the
 surfer village of Crantock, near Newquay, where he was a DJ, playing hip-hop
 records and slipping on occasional strange sounding tapes of his own. He
 always told Richard he was going to press his sounds onto records, and he was
 the first person to ever say that to Richard. They decided they wanted to
 start up their own label originally intended for Richard's own work, but then
 they started getting loads of tapes of everyone, so they started releasing
 other people's as well.

 They didn't get around to any of this until after Richard had already entered
 contracts with (many) other record labels, though. Richard has said that he
 just wanted to see how they all worked, and he needed a lot of record
 contracts to release all of his old material fast enough. Nowadays he's just
 sticking with Warp and Rephlex, and the only reason he's sticking with Warp
 is because he likes the way that it is run. Maybe he still wants to get ideas
 about how to run his _own_ label.



A:11b "What is 'braindance'?"

 According to the Rephlex Records Web site (http://www.rephlex.com/):

 "When Rephlex started in 1991 people said that the type of music we released
 was called 'techno.' People always say that 'things aren't what they used to
 be.' Well, the same could be said for techno.

 "As the years progressed, the media invented more and more terms to describe
 the various sub-genres of music ('intellegent happy hardcore,' 'psychedelic
 handbag,' 'progressive bluntcore,' 'uplifting trance,' etc.). To be honest
 with you this made us confused about how we fit into the dance spectrum. So
 we decided to invent 'braindance,' a genre that encompasses all known genres
 -- to make things simpler.

 "Braindance is not so much a style of music but a way of life. It's a bit
 hard to explain, but if you buy all our releases you should have a better
 grasp of the concept."



A:12 "Who is on the Rephlex artist roster?"

A:13 "Where can I send my demo?"

 Both Warp Records and Rephlex Records welcome demos in any format (MC, CD,
 MD, DAT) but prefer CD and MC. Be warned, though, that they receive hundreds
 of demos a year. When all of them are listened to, they cannot acknowledge
 their arrival and tell you what they thought of each track. If they did this,
 they would never get anything released. If they like what they hear, you
 _will_ be notified. That is why it is extremely important for you to include
 your e-mail address and phone number clearly on both the media and the
 packaging. Mail to:

                Warp Records                 Rephlex Records
                PO Box 474                   PO Box 2676
                Sheffield          or        London

A:14 "Where can I buy Aphex Twin music?"

 In some places it can be very hard to find any Aphex Twin music, but don't
 get too discouraged because certain releases are hard to come by no matter
 where you are located. Here is a list of online distributors of Aphex Twin
 and related music:

         WarpMart                http://www.warprecords.com/warp/mart/
         CDnow                   http://www.cdnow.com/from=sr-1759968

         Throb                   http://www.throb.com/



A:15 "Where can I buy Aphex Twin merchandise?"

 Unfortunately, official Aphex Twin merchandise is no longer available. The
 old address for that is:

                            Aphex Twin
                            Merchandise Dept
                            P O Box 3637
                            London
                            N16 9AZ

 But don't bother writing because that whole operation is no longer in effect
 (read: "out of business"). The address is simply included for posterity.
 Please don't blame anyone if you never get anything from that address.

 The only reasonable alternatives at this point are (1) making your own goods
 by hand or (2) enlisting the help of a local printing shop that can make
 stickers, t-shirts, and everything else that you want _for_ you. Good luck.



A:16 "What Aphex Twin songs have appeared in other media?"

 The Polygon Window track "UT1-dot" is played uncredited in the movie _Blade_
 for about twenty seconds worth during the opening credits.

 Allegedly, Richard has composed numerous songs for commercials including
 those for Virgin Airlines, Lee jeans and Special K breakfast cereal.

 The soundtrack for _Pi_ features "Bucephalus Bouncing Ball," but the track
 makes no appearance in the movie. Possibly it was used in a scene that was
 cut from the final version, but, more likely, it's just a good track that is
 included on the soundtrack for no reason at all.

 "On" is played during one of the many sex scenes in _The Doom Generation_. It
 is credited at the end but is not featured on the soundtrack.

 "Time To Find Me (AFX Fast Mix)" (a remix of a Seefeel track) was used in the
 ending credits to a fashion show called "Perfecto" on MusiquePlus from 1993
 to 1998.

 Caustic Window's "The Garden Of Linmiri" was used in a Pirelli television
 advertisement for tires. The ad featured runner Carl Lewis running through
 New York with tire treads on the bottoms of his feet. Check out a link to
 http://www.pirelli.com/adv/video/10a.avi to download the Windows movie or
 http://www.pirelli.com/adv/video/10a.mov to download the QuickTime version.

 Bank of America has used "Girl/Boy Song" in one of its commercials.

 "Yellow Calx" was used as a theme for the television show "Date With An
 Artist" in the UK.

 The film _8MM_ starring Nicholas Cage features the "Come To Daddy" video
 playing on a television set. The track is played again on a record player as
 a very integral part of the climax of the movie.

 MTV's "The Real World" used "On" during a train ride scene.

 "Windowlicker" was used for the theme in the Eurosport program schedule.

 A commercial for the special Olympics used "Girl/Boy Song" as background
 music.

 The band Placebo samples the computer voice used at the end of "Funny Little
 Man" (see section H.5) for their hidden track "Evil Dildo" from the album
 _Without You I'm Nothing_.

 A slightly edited version of "73-Yips" was used at the end of a Schick
 Diamond razor commercial in the US. In the UK the razors are known as
 Wilkinson Sword and basically the same commercial was used.

 Compaq used "Girl/Boy Song" in one of their ads.

 Orange, a communications company in the UK, used "Girl/Boy Song" for one of
 their ad campaigns.



A:17 "Did I see an ad for _Selected Ambient Works, Vol. 23 2038-2040_?"

 You sure did if you were paying careful attention to the ad at the bus stop
 in the movie _Macross Plus_ (Part 1). It is shown for a fraction of time,
 right before a bus passes in front of it, at which point it changes to
 another ad for something much less interesting.



A:18 "What does Richard drive? Does he really drive a tank?"

 No, on two accounts, but let me explain. First of all, it's not technically a
 tank. Second of all, he doesn't really drive it around right now. It is
 currently at his sister's house in Cornwall where he uses it to chase sheep
 around on the countryside. But he does indeed own a Daimler Ferret Mark 3
 Armoured Scout Car.

 Heavier than 4.5 tons (9000 pounds) when combat-ready and armed with a 7.62
 mm machine gun, the Mark 3 is a dream toy. "Once, I sort of took the front
 end off a sedan that was parked unattended near my house," Richard admits.
 One good thing about the Mark 3 is that it has top speeds of 93 km/h (58 mph)
 in forward AND reverse; he got out of there pretty quickly. The engine is a
 Rolls-Royce B-60 6-cylinder producing 129 hp at 3750 rpm. The Ferret was
 developed by the Daimler company in 1949. Production began three years later
 in 1952 and continued until 1971, during which time some 4500 were built. As
 well as being used by the British Army, they have been adopted by 36 other
 countries.

 The Ferret is basically a four-wheeled car with an all-welded steel body. The
 driver sits in the front of the hull, the centre is the commander's
 compartment, and the engine and transmission are at the rear. Used in every
 internal security campaign from Malaysia through Aden and Cyprus to Ulster,
 it is a fast and handy vehicle and one of the few ATVs that is politically
 acceptable to use on the streets.

 "It's like a giant remote controlled car," quips Richard. "It's got big
 antennas at the back, and you think there must be someone hiding with the
 control box. You can [legally drive it] if you passed your driving test. I
 haven't, but I still drive it on the roads, but you may drive it with another
 driver, and nobody knows who's in it. I've seen loads of police, but they
 just laugh. They never pull you over if you got your insurance. It is really
 cheap, apart from the petrol, 3 miles a gallon. But yeah, in the country
 nothing ever happens. When you bring it to London they will probably get
 worried that you are going to drive through the house of parliament with it.
 You got to be careful, 'cause there are restricted areas in London, for like
 terrorists and stuff, and they might probably think you've got a bomb in it.
 It can easily go through like car blocks and stuff. They will probably get
 really worried."



A:19 "Sandpaper and a food mixer?"

 It started off in 1994 at a club called Disobey, around the corner from where
 Richard lived. He would go down there to see all the weird and wonderful acts
 they had, and one time they asked him to DJ. First, he dropped a tone arm on
 a sheet of sandpaper, sending an ear-shattering roar of scratchy distortion
 through the shocked crowd. Next, he stuck a microphone inside a blender and
 flipped the power switch.

 Disobey really got into it and invited him to go to America to do it again.
 It was only supposed to be a one-off, but they wanted to pay him and take his
 friends, so he did it. It was Blast First Records' showcase in New York, and
 there were people there who danced to it; they thought it was death metal or
 something. He just mixed some sandpaper together for a bit and then played a
 food mixer and threw it at someone. Oops! It hit the bloke on the head. "I
 thought I would get sued for that," Richard worried, "but he wanted me to
 sign it afterward. He said, 'I will keep this food mixer forever.'"



A:20 "Is Aphex Twin online?"

 The fact is that Richard himself is wired to the hilt these days, but he has
 no personal (public) Internet presence. Meaning that he doesn't sit around in
 IRC chat rooms, reading newsgroups, or interacting with his fans as a service
 to them as fans. Surely he has online contacts and personal friends, but if
 you were looking for his e-mail address here, you are out of luck. That is
 not public knowledge. (And, no, I'm not just keeping it from you. I don't
 know it either.)

 On the other hand, if all you want are some good online resources pertaining
 to Aphex Twin, then you might be in more luck than we first expected. Check
 out these sites for starting points into your vast study of Aphex Twin on the
 Internet.

B:1 "What is a digeridoo?"

 A digeridoo is an Australian aboriginal musical instrument. As far as the
 song "Digeridoo" in concerned, Richard has this to say about it:

 "Friends of mine used to organise regular after parties at the beach in
 Cornwall, but they always had trouble to make the people leave at the end. So
 they asked me to make something to shake the people out of their XTC trance,
 a track to end the party with a big bang!"

 That should explain its more than 150 beats per minute.



B:2 "What do those numbers stand for on _Analogue Bubblebath 3_?"

 That's a confusing joke. They are Richard and Grant's post codes, phone
 numbers, and dates of birth all mixed up. Many of the tracks don't even have
 titles.



B:3 "What is the difference between the AB3 releases?"

 The original _Analogue Bubblebath 3_ (CAT008LP) was released in 1992 on vinyl
 with approximately 8 tracks (depending on how you count them). The more
 standard version (CAT008CD) came about in 1993 and was released only on CD.
 It has 13 tracks and two are different from their LP versions. Tracks 3 and 5
 from the CD version are also played as one track 4 on the vinyl release
 (track 3 played in the right channel and track 5 in the left).

 To make matters worse, there was a reissue of the CD in 1997, along with the
 vinyl-only _Analogue Bubblebath 3.1_ (CAT00897). AB3.1 features only four
 tracks; the CD tracks 9, 13, and 8, are used for tracks 1, 2, and 3,
 respectively. The fourth track is a highly modulated conversation about shit,
 faeces, and smelly cunts.



B:4 "What is that last track of _Analogue Bubblebath 4_?"

 That is nothing more than a distorted 27 second clip of a press conference
 held by Evel Knievel, the famous stunt man from the 1970s.



B:5 "Was there ever an _Analogue Bubblebath 5_?"

 Yes, Richard did _Analogue Bubblebath 5_, but he has no plans on releasing
 it. When asked why not he responded: "Because I don't like it, no, I do, but
 not all the tracks, I want better ones on that. Quite often, if you make
 records, very soon after you did the tracks, you change your mind about
 them." However, you never know. There have been indications of AB5 eventually
 being released on CD one day, but there is no date set as of this writing, so
 don't hold your breath.

C:1 "What is the voice saying at the start of 'Italic Eyeball'?"

 Played backwards, the voice sings: "Perhaps I had a wicked childhood." It is
 Maria von Trapp (Julie Andrews) in _The Sound Of Music_. It is also played
 forward later on in the song.



C:2 "What is Richard saying in 'Humanoid Must Not Escape'?"

 Richard isn't saying anything at all. Those voice samples -- the one that
 says "Let's fuck!" and the girl that replies, "Yeah, yeah!" -- are taken from
 David Bowie's "The Man Who Fell To Earth."

 The other sample (the main one) that says "Humanoid must not escape!" comes
 from the video game "Robotron 2084." It must be one of the releases _with_
 the "robot" voice such as the Atari 5200 and standup arcades. The Atari 2600
 didn't really have voices.



C:3 "Why does 'Popcorn' sound so familiar?"

 Perhaps you were forced to listen to the original version by Gershon Kingsley
 (under the name Hot Butter) in nursery school whilst doing a silly dance or
 playing a stupid game. Or maybe you are too old for that and actually bought
 the record when it came out in 1972 on Musicor Records. For more information,
 try heading to http://www.popcornsong.com/ which is a page devoted entirely
 to the song and its various covers (including the version by Richard).



C:4 "What samples does 'Fantasia' use?"

 The samples of "Ooh, ooh! That's great! Yeah!" are allegedly taken from a
 porno flick of the same name. This has not been verified.



C:5 "Will there be another Caustic Window album?"

 "Yeah, I'm doing another Caustic Window album," Richard said of the
 now-released compilation. "I did one but wanted to change a lot of the tracks
 on it, and basically it's on my computer now I'm just trying to find the time
 to finish it now. Mostly older tracks, loads of old ones." Now that the
 compilation is released, there is probably no new Caustic Window material.



C:6 "What does 'Clayhill Dub' mean?"

 "Clayhill Dub" was written about the Clayhill Halls of Residence at Kingston
 Polytech, where Richard lived when he studied there for a year. (See section
 A.6.) The distorted rushing sounds in the track are trains whizzing past the
 halls from Surbiton to Waterloo.

D:1 "Where was _Surfing On Sine Waves_ recorded?"

 The Polygon Window LP was written entirely in the deep south west of Cornwall
 between 1986 and 1989 apart from "Quoth" and "If It Really Is Me," which were
 updated due to a spillage of orange juice on the master tapes. The tracks
 were created in the Llanerlog studios. The studios are set close to the coast
 where the cover photos were taken. 



D:2 "Where were the pictures taken for _Surfing On Sine Waves_?"

 The photo on the front cover shows where there used to be a swimming pool
 made from the rocks of Porthtowan beach in Cornwall. When they were nippers
 they'd stand on a wall for as long as possible and let massive waves crash
 into them. If you fell the right way you'd get mashed on the rocks by the
 sea. "Porth Towan" is even listed in the "thanks to" section on the back of
 the album.



D:3 "Is it true that all the sounds from 'Quoth' were deleted?"

 Yes, the song that features sounds captured from Richard's day job digging
 tunnels was given the distinction of being released and deleted on the same
 day. In fact, all the songs on the LP were deleted.



D:4 "What is the voice saying in 'If It Really Is Me'?"

 At about 4:30 into the song, a woman's voice says, "We have to make a deal.
 You know I accept that fact. Find out who he is not, okay?" Later in the
 song, the line "If it is me," is repeated a couple times.



D:5 "Whose voice is used in 'Supremacy II'?"

 The sample, "Do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti. Oh, let's see if I can make it easier," is
 of Maria von Trapp (Julie Andrews) taken from the movie _The Sound Of Music_.
 She was trying to teach a family of little children to sing. It is, after
 all, a musical.



D:6 "What is that damn computer saying in 'UT1-dot'?"

 The computer is saying something remotely resembling: "Introducing integrated
 inside with electronic techno music, controlled manual by Aphex mind
 program... Acid might kill the population."



D:7 "Will there be any new material coming out from Polygon Window?"

 Not anything new. There was another album that Richard did that didn't get
 released. It will get released someday he reckons. It's just stuff that was
 left over from the first one that he liked just as much, sort of a second
 _Surfing On Sine Waves_. "Probably when I'm dead, they'll find it," Richard
 morbidly states.

E:1 "What does 'Ptolemy' mean?"

 Ptolemy was an ancient astronomer, who put forth the theory -- later
 disproved by Copernicus -- that the earth was the centre of the universe.



E:2 "Who is that talking in 'We Are The Music Makers'?"

 The sample "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams," is
 taken from the movie _Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory_. It is none
 other than Willy Wonka himself (played by Gene Wilder).



E:3 "What kind of cracked-up lunatic...?"

 You must be wondering about _Selected Ambient Works Volume II_. Richard has
 compared it with "standing in a power station on acid."

 "This album is really specific," he says, "because 70 percent of it is done
 from lucid dreaming. To have lucid dreams is to be conscious of being in a
 dream state, even to be capable of directing the action while still in a
 dream. I've been able to do it since I was little," Richard explains. "I
 taught myself how to do it and it's my most precious thing. Through the
 years, I've done everything that you can do, including talking and shagging
 with anyone you feel that takes your fancy. The only thing I haven't done is
 tried to kill myself. That's a bit shady. You probably wouldn't wake up, and
 you wouldn't know if it had worked, anyway. Or maybe you would.

 "I often throw myself off skyscrapers or cliffs and zoom off right at the
 last minute. That's quite good fun. It's well realistic. Eating food is quite
 smart. Like tasting food. Smells as well. I make foods up and sometimes they
 don't taste of anything -- like they taste of some weird mish-mash of other
 things."



E:4 "What is the difference between the SAWII releases?"

 _Selected Ambient Works Volume II_ was released in 1994 in three formats. The
 most complete format is Warp Records' UK 3LP version with a total of 25
 tracks. The next most complete version is Warp's UK 2CD version with a total
 of 24 tracks (missing only track "19" from the LP version). Lastly, there is
 the pathetic Sire Records' US 2CD version with only 23 tracks (missing both
 track "19" and also track "4" from the LP version).

 NOTE: The only way to obtain track "19" in a digital format is to locate a
 copy of _Excursions In Ambience: The Third Dimension_, a compilation that
 features the track "#19" as its own track 10.

    88
   8888

F:1 "What is that awful noise at the start of the 'Ventolin' track?"

 Allegedly, the high-pitched tone in "Ventolin" is the noise you would hear if
 you were to overdose on Ventolin (an inhaler for asthma, also sold as
 Proventil). In the US, the drug itself is known as Albuterol, but in the UK,
 its official name is Salbutamol (hence the Salbutamol mix on the single). If
 you take too much at one time, you see flashes of light and your ears ring
 with that exact pitch.

 Richard himself is an asthmatic. "Yeah, but it's never really bothered me,"
 he says, "never stopped me from doing anything. With 'Ventolin' I tried to
 get it really claustrophobic. I tried to get it like, sort of, similar
 to -- similar sort of feeling to having an asthma attack, which is like
 claustrophobic, basically. But it's not something that -- I've got it, like,
 quite bad, but it's -- I'm not the sort of person to let things like that
 scare me away.

 "I was trying to make it sound like wheezing. Like when you get asthma --
 just the sound it makes -- without sampling myself. I did it just out of
 interest," he says, baldly. "To see if I could get the sound or the same sort
 of feeling -- kind of thing. That's it, really." 



F:2 "Do the other track names for the 'Ventolin' EPs have any meaning?"

 A great deal of the track names on the "Ventolin" EPs are Cornwall related.
 Praze an Beeble, Cornwall, is an actual place, as is Probus. Slightly similar
 to Marazanvose, Marazion is an actual place as well. A coppice is a thicket,
 grove, or growth of small trees. You can find a coppice anywhere you look in
 Cornwall. 



F:3 "What is 'Alberto Balsalm'?"

 Absolutely nothing. Alberto Balsam, on the other hand (without the second
 "L"), is a shampoo made by the Alberto-Culver Company, makers of Alberto VO5.



F:4 "How can I hear the hidden 'I care be-cause you do'?"

 If you listen very carefully to the left channel in "Cow Cud Is A Twin," at
 about 50 seconds into the track you will hear a voice quietly singing "A-phex
 Twin" and then "I care be-cause you do." It will repeat "I care be-cause you
 do" and then start laughing again as the beginning of the track. That
 laughing voice is made using a text-to-speech program for Macintosh computers
 called SimpleText which is similar to SBTALKER from Creative Labs (for the
 PC). The voice is called "hysterical." The same program is also used for the
 "respect list" in "ventolin CROWSMENGEGUS mix" and on _51/13 Aphex Singles
 Collection_ using a voice called "whisper."

 [Hint: To better hear the hidden "I care be-cause you do," listen to the song
 out of phase by either running it through a "stereo voice remover" effect or
 simply loosening headphones from their jack.]



F:5 "What is 'Donkey Rhubarb'?"

 It is a common name for Japanese Knotweed, a plant, whose proper name is
 Reynoutria japonica. It forms thickets of stout, rather zig-zag, red-brown
 stems up to nearly 2 metres high, with broad pointed leaves straight at the
 base. It has white, feathery flowers.

 In the mid-1930s it was known as "Hancocks Curse" in the area surrounding a
 Cornish garden from where it was believed to have escaped, and the garden had
 100 British pounds taken off its market price. Many people know it as "Donkey
 Rhubarb" because one would be a donkey to attempt to eat its rhubarb-like
 stems.



F:6 "What is 'Vaz Deferenz'?"

 The vas deferens is the technical term for the spermatic duct which connects
 the testicles to the prostate and seminal vesicles in male mammals.



F:7 "Who is speaking in 'Come On You Slags!'?"

 The voices are allegedly sampled from the same porno flick called "Fantasia"
 that was used for the Caustic Window track "Fantasia" (see section C.4).

G:1 "Are the string sounds on _Richard D. James Album_ real?"

 According to Richard:

 "Well, they were originally real, yeah. I've got a violin, and a cello as
 well, and I've learned to play that enough to be able to sample it, get some
 good notes, and that's where they come from."

 "Most of the album was done on my Mac, basically. Even the keyboard sounds
 were all pretty much computer-generated. Native audio."



G:2 "Who is that talking to Richard on '4'?"

 Richard is actually letting his dad into his tank there. Richard explains,
 "My dad called me for tea, and I answered. My mum and dad's voices are in
 loads of my old stuff. Six years later I find these conversations I had with
 my dad while I'm in-between hitting something and recording it." That would
 also explain the tape loading noises used throughout the song.



G:3 "Is there any significance to .824545201?"

 There is no confirmed significance to anything Richard does, but PEEK is a
 command in the BASIC computer language. It is a memory function that returns
 the byte stored at a specified memory location. The number .824545201 has no
 special meaning.



G:4 "What does 'Goon Gumpas' sound like?"

 "Sounds like an insurance advert to me," quips Richard. He would know.
 Allegedly he has composed numerous tracks for various commercials, some of
 which we will never even know (see section A.16).



G:5 "Who is the child speaking on 'To Cure A Weakling Child'?"

 "That's my voice, going through my computer and come out the other end,"
 Richard explains. "I said loads of words, and then I chopped them all up and
 made a tune around the words, like, the way I said it and stuff. It's quite a
 good way of writing tunes. It's a bit similar to, like, sometimes I just hit
 the keyboard in the sort of way I'd like the rhythm of the tracks to sound,
 like just hitting 12 notes at a time, and then I'll spend four hours moving
 all the notes where I want them to go."



G:6 "Why the name 'Girl/Boy Song' for a track?"

 The reason Richard came up with that is because he thinks some tracks are
 girl tracks and some are boy tracks. Maybe "Girl/Boy Song" is both.



G:7 "So what is 'Yellow Calx'?"

 That's a boy track according to Richard.



G:8 "Do you think anyone might find the lyrics to 'Milkman' a bit offensive?"

 "Yeah, probably," Richard says. "Well, my mum doesn't find it offensive. My
 girlfriend sings it while she's out shopping. I made it after Tom [Jenkinson]
 said, 'It's all very well making all this jungle, but could we make a proper
 pop song?' So I went and did one." The vocals for the track were modulated
 entirely on the computer.



G:9 "How do I pronounce 'Inkey$'?"

 INKEY$ is a command in the BASIC computer language. It is a device I/O
 function that reads a character from the keyboard. It INputs a KEY and sends
 it to a STRING variable. Properly pronounced 'IN-key-string,' it is also
 referred to simply as 'IN-key.'



G:10 "What is 'Redruth'?"

 Correctly stated, the question is "Where is 'Redruth'?" because Redruth,
 Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, is actually a place.



G:11 "Is that really Richard's gravestone? What's going on?"

 The cover of _Girl/Boy EP_ and the inside artwork for the US release of
 _Richard D. James Album_ feature a photograph of a gravestone inscribed with:

                               RICHARD JAMES
                               NOV  23, 1968

 It is his brother's grave (who died three years before Richard was born).
 When Richard D. was born, his mother named him Richard David James, the same
 name basically. "So I always felt guilty about it," Richard admits, "'cause I
 nicked his name. So the single is basically him, and the album is me.

 "It used to freak me out, 'cause my mom had a photo of this gravestone in her
 room, and when I looked at it when I was young, I didn't understand; 'Why is
 there a gravestone with my name on it?' I didn't realise, until I was older,
 who it was. The photo just freaks me out a bit. It's not every day that you
 can look at a gravestone with your name on it." Though he has never actually
 seen the grave in Canada firsthand. He doesn't even know where it is!

 "Richard D. James is the difference between me and him. Like the 'D' makes
 the whole difference, and I did it for him 'cause I always felt guilty, and
 it's like I wanted to give him something back, something he would be
 remembered by. So I wanted the photo. I'm not really fucked up about it, but
 it's always like been on my mind kind of thing: pointing out the difference
 between the two. As a tribute mainly."

 "Mom and I were talking about it the other day," says Richard. "She didn't
 see it as him dying. It's pretty fucking weird, actually, which is why I like
 [the photograph]. She basically decided I was going to be Richard James
 before I was born, not afterward. I can totally understand why she did it;
 she didn't want to accept the death of the child."

 "That's why I'm the Aphex Twin," he claims. "I feel as if I nicked his
 identity. I reckon he looks after me, like a guardian angel."



G:12 "What is being said at the beginning of 'Girl/Boy (£18 Snare Rush Mix)'?"

 The line "Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing; watching the
 water flow past in the canal" is from the movie _Little Lord Fauntleroy_
 based on the book of the same name.

H:1 "Where was _Come To Daddy_ recorded?"

 It was recorded in the vault of a former bank in Central London. Richard
 bought the bank around the time of the production of _Come To Daddy_ to
 record and live in.



H:2 "Where did Richard get the idea for 'Come To Daddy, Pappy mix'?"

 The lyrics were allegedly written after an obsessed female fan wrote a letter
 to Richard in which she made the passing comment, "I want your soul." It
 seems Richard blew it all out of proportion.



H:3 "What is the voice saying in 'Come To Daddy, Little Lord Faulteroy mix'?"

 It says, "Looking at the swans and hearing the birds singing; watching the
 water flow past in the canal." The same line is used in "Girl/Boy (£18 Snare
 Rush Mix)" (see section G.12). Also heard is the line "Oh, you dirty little
 boy!"



H:4 "What does 'Bucephalus Bouncing Ball' mean?"

 Bucephalus was the horse of Alexander the Great. It is said that 12 year old
 Alexander managed to tame this very vicious and unmanageable horse in front
 of his father, who was very impressed by this and predicted a great future
 for Alexander. He later rode the horse throughout much of his conquests and
 was portrayed with the horse in statues and paintings, which is how it became
 famous. The horse eventually died in India where Alexander named a town in
 its honour, Bucephala. On a side note, the song includes sounds from the
 classic video game _Defender_.



H:5 "What is the computer saying at the end of 'Funny Little Man'?"

 The voice says something resembling: "I would like to fuck you up the
 bunghole, and then I will sneak into your room and cut your cock off and
 stuff it in my mouth, and chew them up with my little boys."



H:6 "Who is that talking at the beginning of 'Come To Daddy, Mummy mix'?"

 That is none other than Richard's own mum telling him, "You've got so many
 machines, Richard." As a side note, the "whooshing" sound heard throughout
 the track is from "Robotron 2084" (see section C.2).



H:7 "What does 'Windowlicker' mean?"

 Maybe it's not particularly relevant to why Richard chose it as a track
 title, but the colloquial French term for "window shopping," ("lécher les
 vitrines") translates literally into English as "to lick the windows." It is
 usually used to describe someone wanting something that they cannot afford.
 Hence "window licker" refers to the two African-American gentlemen shown
 throughout the "Windowlicker" video engaging in the pursuit of women they
 cannot have. All of this makes damn near no sense until you take into account
 the fact that Richard's girlfriend at the time the track was released was
 French. So it still hardly makes any sense, but at least you know _why_ it
 doesn't make sense.

 Slightly less related but possibly of interest to readers outside of London:
 The term "window licker" is [un]commonly used as "a name for the sort of
 'nutter' who sits next to you on the bus and does something weird." (This is
 confirmed by the London Slang Page at http://www.geezer.demon.co.uk/.) Most
 often it is used in a very derogative way in reference to mentally challenged
 children on a mini-bus.



H:8 "What is the voice saying in 'Windowlicker'? It sounds French."

 Indeed it is French. (Read the answer to the previous question regarding why
 in the world Richard has French "lyrics" in his song.) At 2:43 into the CD/LP
 version of "Windowlicker" and 7:03 into the video (where they reach the beach
 palisades) a small female-sounding voice says, "J'aime faire des croquettes
 au chien." Which literally means, "I like to make food for the dog."

 "Croquette" means dog treat, like a milk-bone, or those brown, bone-shaped
 cookies for dogs. Interestingly enough, though, the words are said with a
 French-Canadian accent, not a French-French accent. That seems to piss on the
 notion that it has anything to do with Richard's French girlfriend, unless,
 of course, _she_ is French-Canadian.

 According to Benoit Arsenault:

 "I am a French-Canadian. And, in that sentence, 'croquette' does not seem to
 mean 'food' at all! In the French-Canadian, 'croquette' is mainly used with
 that meaning: a dog 'fait une croquette' when he bites you, but just a little
 bit, to show you his affection; not to hurt you. So, when the girl is saying
 'J'aime faire des croquettes au chien,' that sounds like she likes to bite
 her dog, but just a little bit, to show him her affection. That's quite
 stranger that way, but, if the girl is French-Canadian, I think that that
 interpretation is better."

 One more thing of absolutely no interest:

 In Canada, the French menus at McDonald's list the chicken "McNuggets" as
 "McCroquettes." So maybe that is an indication of exactly what _kind_ of food
 Richard makes for dogs (or has his girlfriend make). Who really knows? Who
 really cares. I don't live in Canada, and I don't speak French at all. All of
 this could be completely made up for all I know.

X:1 "What is 'Aphex Airlines'?"

 Richard was commissioned by Virgin Airlines to write a song for a television
 commercial, and he came up with the track "Aphex Airlines." According to him,
 the song is supposed to represent a jet engine at takeoff. Not surprisingly,
 the Virgin Airlines representatives didn't feel that the song would be very
 appropriate, they thought it would more likely conjure images of airplane
 crashes and death. Though it was never used by Virgin Airlines, it did make
 an appearance on the compilation _Ambient 4 Isolationism_.



X:2 "Why does 'My Teapot' sound familiar?"

 The Polygon Window track "My Teapot" from _Artificial Intelligence II_
 features samples and clips from the last track on AB3.1 (the only track on
 AB3.1 that is not on AB3). See section B.3 for more information regarding the
 differences between the AB3 releases.



X:3 "Is 'Tamphex (Headphuq Mix)' really based on a tampon commercial?"

 The track "Tamphex (Headphuq Mix)" (also spelled "Hedphuq") is available on
 _Classics_ and _Xylem Tube EP_. It is indeed based on an old Tampax tampon
 commercial. The woman is saying, "Are you one of those girls for whom time
 stands still once a month?" and "Why stop when your period starts?"



X:4 "Does the name 'Freeman Hardy & Willis Acid' mean anything?"

 Freeman Hardy & Willis is a shoe store. The sounds similar to those of
 someone tap-dancing may have something to do with that part of the title, and
 the "acid" is probably in reference to the acid jazz bass line. The general
 air of the song really.



X:5 "What is calx?"

 According to Merriam-Webster it is "the crumbly residue left when a metal or
 mineral has been subjected to calcination or combustion." Richard just took a
 liking to the word and has used it for an alias (Blue Calx), a track of the
 same name ("Blue Calx"), and two other tracks ("Green Calx" and "Yellow
 Calx"). There seems to be no connection between any of the tracks.



X:6 "I downloaded this track 'Brivert And Muons.' Which album is it from?"

 First of all, you had better hope that it is not from an album; if it was,
 you downloaded copyrighted material. That's illegal. Luckily, the track was
 never officially "released" on an album. It was a track from the Mike & Rich
 session that was not included on _Expert Knob Twiddlers_. It was made
 available, for a limited time back around 1996, from the old Planet µ site
 (http://freespace.virgin.net/kung.funk/mu.htm) as a free MP3 download.



X:7 "Did Aphex Twin collaborate with LFO on a track?"

 First, no, the track that Pram remixed for the _Warp10+3 Remixes_ compilation
 was a combination of two separate tracks (LFO's "Simon From Sydney" and Aphex
 Twin's SAW2 track 7). Second, in case you were wondering, that LFO is not the
 US boy band; Warp's LFO have been around much longer than the boy band of the
 same name.

Y:1 "What videos have been released by Aphex Twin?"

 The VHS cassette _Come To Viddy_ contains the videos for "On," "Donkey
 Rhubarb," and "Come To Daddy, Director's cut."

 There was also a video for "Ventolin (Video Version)" that is not available
 in retail. Well, not in the US anyway. You can obtain the video for
 "Ventolin (Video Version)" from the Japanese release of _Come To Viddy_.

 The newest video release is "Windowlicker" on a cassette by itself. It can
 also be obtained on the UK _Windowlicker Remixes_ CD in Quicktime format and
 in an edited form on the US _Windowlicker_ CD single.

 "On" (1993)
     directed by Jarvis Cocker & Martin Wallace
     produced by Steve Mackey
  The video for "On" is entirely stop-motion and time-lapse photography. The
  opening scene shows raindrops hitting a pool of water in time with the piano
  sample. You watch as the tide quickly comes in when it pans to a beach which
  features a bunch of seemingly (and most likely) random objects including a
  likeness of Richard and a scuba diver. Day turns to night, and someone plays
  with fire as night turns to day again; back and forth it goes until the
  video fades to black.

 "Donkey Rhubarb" (1995)
     directed by David Slade
     produced by Robert Lloyd
  Here marks the debut performance of the now infamous Donkey Rhubears. (They
  later become the stars of Richard's live performances, at least for a
  while.) The bears dance in a warehouse (where the lighting is just superb!).
  The scene cuts to a playground abounding with children. The Rhubears dance
  and play with them. The remainder of the video goes back and forth between
  these two scenes while the Donkey Rhubears show their stuff.

 "Ventolin (Video Version)" (1995)
     directed by Steve Doughton & Gavin Wilson
  A rather odd video centred around a Ventolin asthma inhaler, industrial
  buildings, smog, and an elevator stuck on the twenty-seventh floor. Just
  plain strange imagery.

 "Come To Daddy, Director's cut" (1997)
     directed by Chris Cunningham
     produced by Cindy Burnay
  Possibly Aphex Twin's breakthrough video for mainstream recognition. An old
  lady just wants to walk her dog as a television set comes to life,
  screaming, "I want your soul. I will eat your soul. Come to daddy!" Dozens
  of children (all with Richard's face) seem to take the message quite
  seriously as they throw rocks, overturn garbage cans, and generally wreak
  havoc. A demonic looking character comes out of the TV and screams at the
  old woman. He gathers all the children around him and then...dances!?!

 "Windowlicker" (1999)
     directed by Chris Cunningham
     produced by Cindy Burnay
  Seemingly made to poke fun of rap videos, the first four minutes is almost
  entirely cursing (or bleeping if you are watching the edited version). An
  extremely long limousine pulls up for about twenty seconds complete with
  AFX logo hubcaps and gas cap. "Richard" gets out, dances (think Michael
  Jackson), and gets the girls. The video is ten and a half minutes long
  including the opening scene and credits. You have to see it to believe it.

-----88------------------------------------------SECTION Z - THE FAQ'S FAQ----

  8888888

Z:1 "Who wrote the FAQ?"

 This Official Unofficial Aphex Twin FAQ was compiled by absolutely no one,
 but go to Aphex Start (http://www.aphextwin.org/) if you wish to contribute
 to, correct, or piss on this FAQ.



Z:2 "What exactly does 'official unofficial' mean?"

 Any FAQ can claim to be unofficial, and it probably is. This FAQ is the
 "official" unofficial Aphex Twin FAQ. Meaning that it is UNOFFICIAL because
 it is not related to Aphex Twin, Richard D. James, Aphex Systems Ltd., Warp
 Records, Rephlex Records, or any other company, group, or person. It is
 OFFICIAL to differentiate it from any other Aphex Twin FAQ you may encounter.
 This is the only OFFICIAL unofficial Aphex Twin FAQ.



Z:3 "Where can I get the newest version of the FAQ?"

 As of this writing, the only official source for the latest version of this
 FAQ is at Aphex Start (http://www.aphextwin.org/) where there will be a link
 of some sort to the latest version. New versions are also posted to the
 rec.music.ambient newsgroup as they are released.

 If you wish to have all new versions sent directly to your e-mail account,
 send an e-mail message to afxfaq-request@aphextwin.org with the word
 "subscribe" (without the quotes) somewhere in the subject of the message.



Z:4 "What's new with this FAQ?"

 Well, this version should hopefully be short-lived while the transition from
 residing on the Aphex Start server is made. For legal reasons, it cannot be
 hosted there at this time. Meanwhile, some additions to this version have
 been the music that Richard likes, a definition of "braindance," a bunch of
 information on miscellaneous tracks and more. Plenty of other updates were
 also made, but I don't feel like checking right now.

 As always, check the flags in the table of contents which are actually used
 and kept track of every time a correction or addition is made. They're
 accurate. Honest.



Z:5 "Is the Aphex Twin FAQ available in other languages?"

 Yeah, right. If you want to translate the whole thing, go right ahead, but as
 of now, there are no other language versions available.



Z:6 "Who helped out?"

 Many people helped to get this FAQ to where it is today. The original version
 was compiled entirely by no one, but now that it has been posted, others have
 contributed to and corrected it. If you feel your name was left out in error,
 please contact your lawyer about it.

 Information was gathered from all over the Internet and many different
 publications. Some of it was common knowledge. Basically, this FAQ was the
 result of one lunatic who loves Aphex Twin so much that he would catch mono
 just to stay home for a week and work on this. Since he has long recovered
 from mono, the job has been taken up by others who are far crazier.
