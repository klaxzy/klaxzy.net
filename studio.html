        <p><h3>the studio 1.2</h3> [actually donno which iteration this is, will figure out once is complete. this is probably already outdated]...</p>

        <p>I started small, my first ever synth was <b>Arturia Microbrute</b> followed by Volca boxes and then I stop paying attention. I ended up having 3 modular cases, many synths, drum machines, effects... I really liked physical touch of the knob and that did something with the sound once I turn it. I never had patience with DAWs and software, pointing and moving the mouse to turn the parameter or click on the button was never really my thing. When I got my first computer I quickly discovered <b>ReBirth RB-338</b> and it was a great fun, an instant techno machine, I loved it but never had a patience to dive deep and get something serious out of it. Around the same time I tried to get along with Propellerhead Reason, Cubase and Fruity Loops but everything seamed so complex and overwhealming and that was where my interest got lost.</p>

        <p>Then, everything [re]started again when I moved to Berlin and had the chance to find the way I like to make the tunes and slowly get peace by peace which is now my hobby and my home studio.</p>

        </ul>

        <p><h2>the music:</h2></p>

        <p>I only had 2 musical phases in my life, 1.techno/electronic/ambient/idm and 2.rock/grunge phase and I never really listened anything else but that. The first is still very active and this is the music I [try to] create, the second is really a phase coming in and out there and then. I (roughly) devide the music in two cathegories, music for the brain and music for the body. Music for the body I mostly find in clubs [and sometime at home], this gives me great energy to dance. Music for the brain gives me goosebumps and emotions, this is often music I return to and listen on and on again, majority of my favorite bands and DJs are going in this cathegory.</p>

        <p>Most of my listening history is sent to <b><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.last.fm/user/klaxzy">LastFM</a></b></p>
